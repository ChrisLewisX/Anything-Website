- CAMRA ValeOfGlamorgan WEBSITE -
  > I developed the CAMRA website which you can find at : http://vog.camra.org.uk/index.html
  > I keep adding small additions to the site over time and maintain it as best I can, while also making
  > improvements suggested by the client and the customers (Last modified : 16/10/2017).
  
  > For this project I worked on the front and back end. With only the previous website to go off I re-designed the
  > layout and after getting approval from the client started programming.  
  > I used a combonation of html5, css and Javascript and refactored the website so it would be mobile friendly.
